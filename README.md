# Project Overview
This is a long-term project where I will be writing my own rendering engine and building a voxel survival, town management, factory building, and exploration game entirely in Rust with Vulkan. This is

- Players and NPCs will start with a basic shovel, pickaxe, axe, and handsaw. 
  - Saws cut branches faster than axes, but axes break whole trees, timber voxels, glass, and sticks and thick logs faster.

## NPCs
- These settler npcs will include 1 Oracle (based on Terraria's Guide NPC, will provide information, recipes, and hints to the player), and 3-5 standard NPCs who can be assigned simple tasks

## The Player

## The World
- One block is 24^3 voxels. The player will be exactly 23 voxels tall.
- Like other voxel games, the world will be broken down into chunks. However,
